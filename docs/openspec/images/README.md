Screenshots (small, optional)

Recommended files to place here (PNG, small size):
- gui_main.png — GUI main window
- gui_after_run3d.png — After a 3D run with summary open
- gui_after_run2d_axial.png — After a 2D axial run with summary open

Tips
- Prefer UTF-8 paths; avoid very large PNGs. Compress/resize before commit.
- This folder is configured in .gitignore to ignore PNG/JPG by default to prevent large binaries from bloating the repo.
- If you want to commit screenshots, temporarily remove patterns in .gitignore and keep image sizes small.
